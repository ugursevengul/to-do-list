### Features of this project
- Allows users to create a to-do list with items that can be checked off when completed
- Uses local storage to save the to-do list, so it can be accessed even if the page is refreshed or closed
- Handles adding and removing items from the to-do list
- Toggles the checked class to mark items as complete when clicked
- Displays pop-up messages (toasts) to provide feedback to the user when an item is added or deleted
- Uses the Bootstrap library to create the toasts
